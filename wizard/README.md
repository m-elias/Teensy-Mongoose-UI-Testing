# Mongoose Wizard Project

This project is generated by Mongoose Wizard, https://mongoose.ws/wizard/

It implements networking on Arduino environment that uses W5500 ethernet module.

## Build and flash

**Step 1.** Download generated project to your workstation.
  Click on the "sync" or ".zip" button to download the project to your workstation
**Step 2.** Open the project in your Arduino IDE. 
**Step 3.** Open wizard.ino and check the SPI pin numbers, make sure they match your wiring.
  Make changes if necessary
**Step 4.** Open `mongoose_glue.c` and edit glue functions to attach UI controls to the
  hardware. For example, to example LED toggling from a Web UI dashboard:

```c
```

**Step 5.** Click on the Run button to build and flash. Open Serial Monitor to see the logs

## File structure

- `mongoose.{c,h}`       - This is Mongoose Library, a full TCP/IP + TLS stack
- `mongoose_config.h`    - (only if present). Mongoose settings file
- `mongoose_fs.c`        - Embedded filesystem. Contains Web UI files and TLS certs
- `mongoose_impl.c`      - Generated network functionality
- `mongoose_glue.{c,h}`  - A "glue", or "binding" functions for your code
